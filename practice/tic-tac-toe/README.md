# Tic Tac Toe 

A try to build a very basic  command line 'TIC TAC TOE' Game in Python using concepts like classes

One is human payer with 'X',
an the other is Computer player with 'O' who is choosing randomly from the avilable boxes.

After every move if we check if we have a Winner,
in the end if there is no winner it's a Tie.
